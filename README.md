# Customer Cohort Retention Analysis

## Overview
This project addresses the challenge of long-term customer loyalty by building a 13-month Retention Matrix from over 500,000 e-commerce transactions in MS SQL Server. The technical architecture leverages nested CTEs to define first-purchase cohorts and the PIVOT clause to transform long-form data into a digestible month-over-month decay visualization. The final Tableau heatmap serves as a vital diagnostic tool for product teams, highlighting specific acquisition windows that yielded the highest sustained user engagement.
